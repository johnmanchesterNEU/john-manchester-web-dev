Widgets uses the eye icon to toggle sortable on and off.
Videos and inputs throw a div over it to allow dragging anywhere in the document.
Sortable is updated and works on the database. However, I would like to have a method that ensure reorder occur in the right
order everytime

Form validation works for all required fields.
